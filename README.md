# 🛡️ Network Security Monitoring using Snort & Splunk

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Network Traffic Monitoring System** that detects malicious activities, generates security alerts, and visualizes logs in **Splunk dashboards**.  
It was developed as part of MSc Cybersecurity coursework at **Marwadi University** (2025-26).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Continuous monitoring of network traffic.  
- Early detection of suspicious activities and intrusions.  
- Visualization of security events for easier decision-making.  
- Actionable insights to strengthen overall security posture.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Snort IDS** → Captures and analyzes suspicious traffic.  
- **Splunk Enterprise & Universal Forwarder** → Collects, indexes, and visualizes logs.  
- **Linux (Ubuntu)** → Victim machine with Snort IDS.  
- **Kali Linux** → Attacker machine (port scans, brute-force, DoS).  
- **VMware Workstation** → Virtualized test environment.
